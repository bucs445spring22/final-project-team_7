1) Do you want to have an account (forced login)?
 - guest login and user login,
 - guest would have less functionality (bring to login page/signup if try to do something without logging in).
 - forced login if above is too hard
2) What is the timeframe?
 - 6 months
3) What problem are you trying to solve?
 - Client wants an application to keep track of media. Movies, shows, or maybe even comics and it will be a consolidation of all those services.
 - Client wants to watch shows, but it’s a mess to track them so this would solve the problem
 - Doesn’t want to make accounts in all these other websites and want it in one where he can control.
4) What is the most important feature?	
 - Client can add things he wants to a list and keep track of all the stuff he watched
 - Wants information about the watched shows as well (title, ratings, genre, similar shows)
5) Is there a similar product on the market? 
 - All those services like IMDB, but there are too many, so client wants a consolidated solution to track shows
6) Are there any existing product or technologies that will need to be integrated?
 - We would need APIs from different existing movie trackers like IMDB.
7) What does success look like?
 - Client wants all the features listed before to be fulfilled without losing sight of the main project
 - Don’t have stuff/bloat that client doesn’t want or hasn’t asked for
 - Need good looking GUI because client isn’t good at technology
8) What is the lifetime of this software?
 - It should last as long as the client wants to use it (as long as the client is watching movies)
9) Is it single use or does it need to last 20 years?
 - It needs to last 20 years.
10) What additional features would you like?
 - Login, users, as many types of media, rating system** (local user rating and IMDB rating)
