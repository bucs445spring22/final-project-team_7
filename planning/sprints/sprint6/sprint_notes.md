## Sprint Review

### SRS Sections Updated

- Added requirement ability to remove a movie

###  User Story:
 
- After I finish watching a movie or TV Show, I would like to be able to rate it from 1-10 stars. I would leave a 1 star rating if I disliked the movie/show or a 10 star rating if I enjoyed it.
 
- I want to be able to look at the movies and their information that I add to my list
 
- As a confused movie watcher, I want to be able to remove a movie from my list if I no longer want it there.

## Sprint Planning

### Requirement Target:

Ability to give a rating to a movie
 
Ability to get recommended movies

### User Stories:

As a movie watcher, I want a way to rate the shows that I watch. This would allow me to record my content preferences and compare them with other users on the same server.
 
As a movie enthusiast, I want to be able to view more detailed information about movies to decide what to watch next.
 
### Planning

Need to continue the development of the application. Ratings are good. May want to implement ability to see what other people in the application have in their libraries.

### Action Items:

We need to take action to add ratings to our application and continue fleshing out the database and the page where more in depth movie metadata is shown.

### Issues and Risks:

As the semester draws to a close, we need to start focusing on what remaining features we want to implement and make sure those features are working properly.

### Team Work Assignments:

Yong will continue integrating database into project containers

Andrew will include rating values into classes

Ronald will continue developing front end and database, mainly the page where more details about a movie or show are shown
