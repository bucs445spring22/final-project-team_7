Added 1 non-functional requirement
Accessibility

###  User Story:

As a client, I want to be able to track movies that I’ve watched and add them to a list.

### Requirement Implemented

Step towards ability to add movies to a list (added class for MediaEntry).

### Completed Items

Added class: MediaEntry.py
Created requirements file

### Uncompleted Items

None

### The summary of the entire project:

A watchlist for movies/shows. It will have the ability to rate shows, keep track of watched shows, and display relevant information about watched shows (cover art, actors, genres, etc).

***

## Sprint Planning

### Requirement Target:

Design API class, use API successfully (potentially work on parse as well)
Design front-end (github login page similarity for homepage)
Maybe start some code
Movie class that extends the MediaEntry class

### User Stories:

As a client, I want to be able to track movies that I’ve watched and add them to a list.

### Planning

Design API class, design front-end, and create movie class that extends the MediaEntry class

### Action Items:

We must implement a request to the API (which will be chosen based on needs) to return the JSON file with the data and have an understanding of how the login page will look. We must implement a movie class and think about how it would extend the MediaEntry class.

### Issues and Risks:

Obstacles could include API not working properly and returning information we need.

### Team Work Assignments:

- Andrew will design API class 
- Yong will work on the movie class that extends the MediaEntry Class
- Jin will work on front end design
- Anyone who has additional time will put it towards coding flask templates and parser for JSON
