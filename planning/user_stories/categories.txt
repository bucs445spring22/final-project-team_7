Categories

As a confused movie watcher, I want a category system to make it easier for me to find the shows I want.

Acceptance:
- Category system for sorting watched shows.
- Must be easy to navigate through library.

Notes:

Persona: 
 - John Smith
 - He is very bad at navigating applications and finding things
 - Prone to giving up
 - Wants to have application where it's easy to find things
