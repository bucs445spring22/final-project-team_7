scalable_to_media_types

As a confused media watcher, I want a system where if I want another type of media added, it would be easily done. 

Acceptance:
- Application should be able to be scaled with different media types easily.
- If users wanted additional media types like T.V. shows or books, it should be able to be scaled easily.
- Should be a function to search for multiple types of media
