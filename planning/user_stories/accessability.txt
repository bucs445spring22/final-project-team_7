accessability

As a confused movie watcher, I want a category system to make it easier for me to find the media I want.

Acceptance:
- Must be easy to use the application in terms of adding shows and sorting already added.
- Have a category system for different types of medias

Notes:

Persona:
- Andrew Johnson
- Constantly searching for things
- Hates messy websites
- Wants to search for the shows he watches
