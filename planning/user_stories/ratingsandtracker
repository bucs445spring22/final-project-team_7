Ratings and tracker

As an avid movie watcher, I want an application where I can track multiple movies that I’ve watched (add them to a watched list) and rate them on a website to remember how much I liked it. I would also like to see other people’s ratings on that local website as well as the general rating on big movies sites like IMDB. I would also like to have other lists for movies that I can add to which I plan to watch.

Acceptance:
Simple rating system within the local website
Ability to add movies to different lists
