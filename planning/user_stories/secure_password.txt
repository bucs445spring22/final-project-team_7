secure_password

As a user I want to be able to make a secure account and not have to make a new one every time.

Acceptance:
- When signing up with a new account the application should hash the password so that it is not just there open in the database
- Password is checked against its hash on login and is hashed on signup
- User does not need to worry about password leaks

Notes:

Persona:
- Name Unknown
- Aware that the FBI is watching him
- Doesn't trust anybody
- Only leaves his house once a month to avoid being on security cameras
