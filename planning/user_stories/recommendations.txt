Recommendations

As a movie enthusiast, I want to be able to view more detailed information about movies and know what to watch next.

Persona: Bored Timmy
Bored Timmy has a lot of free time on his hands as he is the son of a rich businessman and he spends most of his day watching movies and TV shows.
He will occasionally stream the movies/shows he watches to his friends on discord, but often run out of ideas of what they all collectively would enjoy.
His goal is to have an easily usable website to keep track of all movies watched and all future information.
Title: Recommendations, a Notifier, and Accessibility
After watching a good movie or a good TV show, Timmy would like to have the option to see recommendations for similar movies or shows to the current one Timmy has finished watching.
Timmy would also like to receive notifications for when the date of the sequel is known for the shows Timmy has watched.
Timmy is lazy and would like to have a "remember me" option when signing into the website so he doesn’t have to continuously relog in.
A light and dark mode for the website is a must has Timmy has sensitive eyes.
Acceptance:
A recommendation system, light/dark mode, and a notifier to notify when a sequel is announced for a show/movie I’ve watched.
