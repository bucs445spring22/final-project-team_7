Docker

As a client, I want an application that I can deploy on any server running Docker

Acceptance:
- Dockerfiles for each segment of the program.
- Docker-compose file to easily launch the application.

Notes:

Persona:
 - John Smith
 - Bad at setting up dependencies for the programs he wants to run
 - Hates dealing with lots of small things
 - Wants an easy way to run his program on any system
